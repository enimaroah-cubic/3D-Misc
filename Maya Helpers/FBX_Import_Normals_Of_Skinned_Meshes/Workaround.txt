FBX importer kills normals of skinned meshes and generates new ones

Workaround:
1) In Sb3UGS export twice: once with "Skin" option, once without
2) In Maya import one file, rename the each mesh, import second file
3) For each mesh pair (unskinned and skinned counterpart):
	select unskinned mesh first, then the skinned to
		Mesh / Transfer Attributes []
		-> Attributes To Transfer
			Vertex Normal: On
			all others: off
		-> Attribute Settings
			Sample Space: Component
			Mirroring: off
			Search method: Closest to point
4) Dont delete any of the unskinned meshes or select the skinned meshes and
   Mesh Display / Lock Normals
5) FBX export now provides the correct normals for both types of meshes
6) If any unskinned meshes were exported, then uncheck them in Sb3UGS before replacing

The MEL command for the transfer:
transferAttributes -transferPositions 0 -transferNormals 1 -transferUVs 0 -transferColors 0 -sampleSpace 4 -sourceUvSpace "map1" -targetUvSpace "map1" -searchMethod 3-flipUVs 0 -colorBorders 1 ;
